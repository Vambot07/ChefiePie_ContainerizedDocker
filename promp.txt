so how can i make user can click the recipe on the RecipeComparisonModal, then iwt will follow these use case

UC-19 :Suggest Substitution Description This use case allows the system to suggest ingredient substitutions when a required ingredient for a selected recipe is unavailable. The system uses the list of identified ingredients from the image recognition process (UC16 and UC17) to determine which ingredients are missing and suggests suitable substitutions. If no substitutions are available, it checks if the missing ingredient is critical. If critical, it triggers UC20: Alert Essential Ingredient. Actors User, System Preconditions The user has selected a recipe (UC18). The system has identified the available ingredients using image recognition (UC16 and UC17). The recipe requires ingredients that are missing or cannot be found in the available list. Postconditions A list of suitable ingredient substitutions is displayed for any missing ingredients. If no substitutions are available, the system checks if the missing ingredient is critical, triggering UC20: Alert Essential Ingredient if needed. Main Flow 1. The user selects a recipe based on the identified ingredients (UC18). 2. The system compares the identified ingredients with the required ingredients in the recipe. 3. The system identifies any missing ingredients. 87 4. The system checks for substitutions for the missing ingredients using predefined data or an AI model. 5. If substitutions are found: ● The system displays a list of suitable substitutions for the missing ingredients (e.g., "You can use coconut milk instead of cream"). 6. If no substitutions are available: ● The system checks if the missing ingredient is essential for the recipe. ● If the ingredient is essential, the system triggers UC20: Alert Essential Ingredient. ● If the ingredient is not essential, the system proceeds with the recipe (either skip the ingredient or proceed without alerting the user). Alternative Flow @Step 5: No Substitutions Available If no substitutions are available for a missing ingredient, and if the ingredient is not essential, the system allows the user to proceed without the ingredient, or with a workaround. 88 UC-20 :Alert Essential Ingredient Description This use case describes the system's ability to alert the user when a critical or essential ingredient is missing from a selected recipe and no suitable substitutions are available. The system ensures that users are aware of the impact of the missing ingredient on the recipe and suggests alternative recipes if necessary. Actors System, User Preconditions The user has selected a recipe (UC18). The system has identified the available ingredients using image recognition (UC16 and UC17). The system has checked for ingredient substitutions (UC19) and found that no substitutions are available. The system has determined that the missing ingredient is critical. Postconditions The system informs the user about the missing essential ingredient and its impact on the recipe. The system may recommend alternative recipes that do not require the missing ingredient. Main Flow 1. The system checks the missing ingredients in the selected recipe (UC19). 2. The system identifies that a critical ingredient is missing and no substitutions are available. 3. The system alerts the user that the ingredient is essential and cannot be replaced (e.g., "This ingredient is critical and cannot be substituted"). 89 4. The system informs the user of the impact on the recipe (e.g., "The dish cannot be completed without this ingredient"). Alternative Flow @Step 5: Proceed with the Original Recipe The user may acknowledge the alert and decide to proceed without the missing ingredient, understanding that the final dish may be affected (e.g., "I’ll proceed with a modified version of the recipe").
